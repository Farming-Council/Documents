# Privacy Policy
At any time, the bot may log information about the commands used, including User ID and Minecraft UUID, to allow me to improve the bot and reduce the amount of errors.

In the bot's home Discord Server, [Farming Council](https://discord.gg/farmingcouncil), the bot collects and saves User ID and Minecraft UUID, used for our Minecraft Linking system and to automatically give you specific roles.

The bot neither saves any data nor passes data on to third parties, if the bot is used on a different Server than Kuudra Gang. Especially, the bot is able to read messages from users on any server it is in.

# Data deletion
If you want your data to be deleted, please send an email to management@farmingcouncil.com and we will delete all data that is saved about you. Please note that this will remove your access from the [Farming Council](https://discord.gg/farmingcouncil) Discord Server permanently.

# Contact
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy feel free to send an email to management@farmingcouncil.com or open a ticket in the [Farming Council](https://discord.gg/farmingcouncil) Discord Server.
